[Build instructions (for a first time):]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. download only odp_apps repo. (this one). there is no need to download libpcap one.
# git clone git@github.com:repu1sion/odp_apps.git

2. if you already did this then just "git pull" to get updates
# git pull

3. "make" from odp-apps. libpcap and odp-git will be downloaded automatically.this is enough. a
# make

make will automatically get into libpcap dir and execute makefile from it  with "./configure --with-odp=$(ODP_DIR)"
so you don't need to set it manually


[Rebuild instructions (to pull latest sources):]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ./rebuild.sh
